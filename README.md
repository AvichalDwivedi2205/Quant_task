1. Data Preparation:
• Load the dataset and perform an initial exploration to understand
its structure and contents.
• Clean the data as you deem appropriate.
• Split the dataset into training and testing subsets (e.g., 80% training,
20% testing).
2. Model Implementation:
• Implement multiple linear regression model using scikit-learn in
Python (or any other library in your preferred choice of programming
language).
• Train the model using the training dataset.
• Predict the target variable on the testing dataset.

3. Model Evaluation:
• Evaluate the model performance using appropriate metrics, such as
R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared
Error (RMSE).

• You may consider using various models (see: Ridge, Lasso, Best sub-
set etc.), and choose the best model according to you.

4. Model Diagnostics (Optional)
• Check for multicollinearity among predictors using Variance Inflation
Factor (VIF) or correlation matrices.

• Perform hypothesis testing on the coefficients to assess their signifi-
cance.

• Assess the model assumptions (linearity, homoscedasticity, normality
of residuals) and identify any violations.
